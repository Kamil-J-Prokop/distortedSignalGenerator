# distortedSignalGenerator
This script is used to generate data to train neural network. Intention is to set parameters of the desired set of signals, that would be equally distributed among all of generated time-series files. To be more precise - as an input we give signal parameters and recieve defined number of files containing signals with distortion to train NN.
